# Traditional Finnish Cinnamon Roll Recipe
(Bake in 225ºC / 430ºF for 10-15 minutes. The recipe makes about three baking trays of buns)

## Ingredients:

### Dough:
5 dl / 2 cups milk
50 g fresh yeast / 2,5 tbsp dry yeast
1 egg
2 dl / about ¾ cup sugar
1-2 tbsp cardamom
1 tsp salt
13-15 dl/ 5,5-6 cups white wheat flour (all-purpose)
150-200 g / ¾ cup of butter, but could use a little more or less

### Filling:
100 g / about 1/3 cup butter
cinnamon
sugar

### Finishing:
1 egg

### Decoration:
sugar (not necessary)

## Instructions

1. Start by taking butter to soften in room temperature about an hour before you start to make the dough.

2. Warm up the milk so that it’s luke warm. Sprinkle in the yeast and blend. With dry yeast milk needs to a bit warmer.

3. Add sugar, egg, cardamon, salt and about 3/4 of flours.

4. Put your hand in the dough, add the softened butter and start kneading the dough. Add the rest of the flour little by little while kneading.

Please note that kneading the dough is a very important part of making the cinnamon rolls! The more you knead, the fluffier the dough gets. Patience pays!

5. Knead dough until it is smooth and a bit bouncy. The dough is perfect when you can remove it from the bowl so that it does not stick to the edges too much. If it does, add a little bit of flour and knead a bit more.

6. Raise the dough in a warm spot under a cloth. Let it raise for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until it has doubled its size.

SaimaaLife tip! I usually put the dough bowl into a bigger pan with warm water because warm temperature makes the dough raise faster. This time our dough was left to raise in the warmth of the sun and our grandma’s wood-fired stove.

7. As the dough is raising, take the butter to be used for the filling from the fridge and let it soften in room temperature.

8. Lightly flour a clean work surface with all-purpose wheat flour. Pour the dough to the table and split it in three parts.

9. Using the rolling pin, roll the dough out to make rectangular sheets (about 30 x 50-60 cm).

10. Spread the softened butter with a knife on each of the dough sheets. Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top of the butter layer.

11. Roll the dough sheet into a tight roll and leave the seam underneath the roll.

12. Cut the roll into to a triangle-shaped pieces.

13. Place the pieces on the table the narrower side facing up. Use your thumb to press the top of the pieces all the way to the bottom.

14. Lift the ready buns on the baking tray (use parchment paper to prevent sticking) and let them raise under the cloth while pre-heating the oven to 225ºC.

15. When the oven is ready and the cinnamon rolls have risen, finish them by applying egg with a baking brush. Decorate the cinnamon rolls with sugar crystals or fine sugar if you wish.

16. Bake in 225ºC for 10-15 minutes.

17. The cinnamon rolls are ready when the color turns into golden brown. Some like them lighter, some darker –  try and see which one works best for your taste buds.
